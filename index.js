/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Global Binding

  Global binding when "this" is called will show pretty much everything of javascript. its the entire thing.

  2. Implicit Binding

  is when you use a period or "dot" and it becomes that object, this.name etc...

  3. New Binding

  This is when it refers to a new constructor e.g. const cats = new catFur('long'); etc...

  4. Explicit Binding

  Basically is like an over ride, using .cal or .apply
